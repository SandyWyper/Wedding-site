                  The wedding ceremony and reception will take place at
                  Bedruthan Steps camping field, just outside the village of
                  Mawgan Porth, near Newquay, Cornwall. This is a gently sloping
                  grass field with a gravel path alongside. There is access to
                  Bedruthan Steps beach from the field via 100 metres of the
                  coast path and 149 steep steps (steps may be closed if there
                  has been recent rockfall). The postcode for this location is
                  PL27 7UW and it is situated on the B3276 Newquay-Padstow coast
                  road. When approaching from Newquay, it is the next left after
                  the National Trust Carnewas shop and caf√©.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is free parking onsite at the venue. The site is not
                  serviced by local public transport so you will need to either
                  drive or take a taxi to the venue. We will be providing
                  transport back to Newquay throughout the evening from 7pm.

              The wedding ceremony and reception will take place at Bedruthan
              Steps camping field, just north of the village of Mawgan Porth,
              near Newquay, Cornwall. You can join us in camping on site, or
              there will be a shuttle bus running back and forth to Newquay, so
              you may prefer accomodation along this route. We ask all guests to
              arrive at 1.30pm, the ceremony will start at 2.00pm.

                Although this coast can have stunning weather it is rather
                exposed, so we recomend coming prepared. It can be blistering
                hot, or if the wind comes from the north it can be a bit chilly.
                Especially in the evening, so make sure to bring layers. The
                tents are huge, so if the heavens were to open then we should
                all remain dry and have a great view all the same. If you're
                camping, there are toilets, showers and running water. The field
                is right above the beach, however there was a rock slide in the
                winter so the steps remain closed at the moment. There's no
                shortages of beaches nearby.

              Bedruthan Steps has been officially accredited with Dark Sky
              Discovery Status, which means that it is away from the worst of
              any local light pollution and provides excellent stargazing
              conditions so make sure you are warm enough to enjoy it should the
              skies be clear enough. If you are local and able to, we encourage
              you to bring along a blanket or two so we can all keep cosy having
              a drink around the open fire.

              <p>
                It is a wedding so worth dressing up for but we are happy for
                you to wear whatever is comfortable. Kilts welcome! Due to the
                nature of the site, we strongly recommend flat shoes only for
                your own comfort and safety. The wedding and reception will be
                held inside giant tepees which will be adequately warm, however,
                there is lots of outdoor space to enjoy and it may get quite
                cool in the evening so we recommend taking a warm coat with you.
              </p>
              <h3>Drinks</h3>
              <p>
                We will be providing a free bar of wine, beer, cider and soft
                drinks for you to enjoy throughout the day and evening. For the
                evening reception, if you would like to bring any spirits along
                with you to contribute to the bar, we will provide the mixers,
                fruit, ice, etc. You will not need to pay for drinks so no need
                to worry about bringing cash.
              </p>
              <h3>Children</h3>
              <p>
                Your children are more than welcome on the day. There will be a
                kids‚Äô play tent available where kids can play together and make
                friends. Maybe bring a toy along to play with so mum and dad can
                enjoy a prosecco or five!

              people around to set up/take down the wedding teepees and other
              equipment on the days surrounding the wedding. If you would like
              to camp and would like help sourcing a tent and other camping
              gear, we will see what we can do for you. Alternatively, there is
              a huge amount of accommodation available in the local area. We

            <p>
              It is a wedding so worth dressing up for but we are happy for you
              to wear whatever is comfortable. Kilts welcome! Due to the nature
              of the site, we strongly recommend flat shoes only for your own
              comfort and safety. The wedding and reception will be held inside
              giant tepees which will be adequately warm, however, there is lots
              of outdoor space to enjoy and it may get quite cool in the evening
              so we recommend taking a warm coat with you.
            </p>
            <h3>Drinks</h3>
            <p>
              We will be providing a free bar of wine, beer, cider and soft
              drinks for you to enjoy throughout the day and evening. For the
              evening reception, if you would like to bring any spirits along
              with you to contribute to the bar, we will provide the mixers,
              fruit, ice, etc. You will not need to pay for drinks so no need to
              worry about bringing cash.
            </p>
            <h3>Children</h3>
            <p>
              Your children are more than welcome on the day. There will be a
              kids‚Äô play tent available where kids can play together and make
              friends. Maybe bring a toy along to play with so mum and dad can
              enjoy a prosecco or five!

              Newquay is where we live and the travel hub for this part of
              Cornwall. There is the biggest selection of accommodation in
              Newquay, but the areas of Watergate Bay and Mawgan Porth also have
              accommodation and will be closer to the wedding venue but have
              less in the way of amenities. If you need any help whilst booking
              travel or accommodation, we are happy to give you advice.

                    The main motorway to Cornwall is the M5 serving Exeter,
                    Bristol and all points North whilst from London the choice
                    is the mainly dual carriageway A303/A30 or the M4/M5 via
                    Bristol. From Exeter follow the A30 to Cornwall and Newquay
                    is fully signposted from the A30.

                    Newquay is on its own branch line, the Par to Newquay
                    Atlantic Coast Line. Par is the connection to the ‚ÄòPlymouth
                    to Penzance‚Äô main line and is just outside St Austell, on
                    the Cornish south coast. The Plymouth to Penzance mainline
                    then connects country wide. In the summer, normally from the
                    end of May to the end of September, Newquay has direct
                    trains from London, Bristol, Birmingham, Yorkshire, the
                    North East and Scotland. Great value fares can be found if
                    you book in advance, the earlier you book the more you save.
                    The railway station is located in the heart of the town on
                    Cliff Road. The train station is seasonally manned and does
                    not have an automated ticket machine so when the ticket
                    office is not open, tickets can be bought either on the
                    train or online.

                    Newquay is part of the National Express network and the main
                    stop is at Newquay Bus Station on Manor Road, just off the
                    town centre and right behind our house. There is a secondary
                    stop at Porth Four Turns on Henver Road but this is for
                    passengers with hand luggage only as the vehicle cannot stop
                    long enough to open its main luggage compartment. The
                    Megabus coach service has a stop at Newquay bus station but
                    this can only be booked in advance through their website.
